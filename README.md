# Data and Databases

Columbia University, Lede Program

Tuesdays and Thursdays, May 24th 2016 through July 7th 2016, 10am

[Allison Parrish](http://www.decontextualize.com/), instructor.

Office hours: By appointment only.

For FERPA reasons, I ask that you e-mail me [at my Columbia
address](mailto:ap3328@columbia.edu) when discussing any matters related to
this class or your grade. Personal or professional inquiries can go to [my
personal address](mailto:allison@decontextualize.com).

## Description

Consideration of both the scientific and social implications of counting, of
turning the world into bits. Through the process of gaining fluency in the use
of Python, students will spend some time thinking through representations of
core "data types" like time, location, text, image, sound and relationships (or
networks), and the computational "affordances" associated with each. Students
will study several common metaphors for organizing and storing data â€“ from
structureless key-value stores, to a single table or spreadsheet, to the
"multiple tables" of a relational database. We will also discuss ideas behind
publishing or sharing data, moving from HTML documents and Web 1.0 to data
services and APIs in Web 2.0, to semantics in Web 3.0. Student work and
discussion will underscore the reality that data are plentiful and circulate
and interact in a kind of informational ecosystem. As researchers, our students
will be called on both to access and to publish data products.

## Homework assignments

There will be six homework assignments in this class, each assigned on Thursday
and due the following Tuesday before the beginning of class. The homework
assignments are designed to test and expand your knowledge of the technical
concepts introduced in class. Each homework assignment is worth 10% of your grade.

With the exception of the first assignment, all homeworks will take the form of
an IPython Notebook that you fill in and send to a TA for grading. (We'll
discuss the specifics of this in class.)

## Grading

- 40% Attendance and participation
- 60% Homework assignments (10% each)

## Schedule and notes

### Week 1 (May 24 and 26)

Homework #1 (due May 31): Read and respond to the following.

* [Relational and Non-Relational Models in the Entextualization of
  Bureaucracy](http://computationalculture.net/article/relational-and-non-relational-models-in-the-entextualization-of-bureaucracy)

These essays each address the limits and consequences of data-driven analysis
and public policy. Your response should take the form of a brief e-mail (no
more than 3-5 paragraphs) [sent to me](mailto:ap3328@columbia.edu). In your
response, describe the critique of one or more of the essays and discuss *how*
(if at all) you might incorporate their critique(s) into your practice as a
journalist. Also in your e-mail, include and comment on a link to an essay or
article that you feel "speaks to" the points raised in one or more of the
essays (e.g., agrees with, provides a counterexample, expands upon, responds
to).
